I.  Adventure, Release 3

Adventure, Release 3, is a maintenance release of Adventure.
The release kit contains the following files:

	-ADVENT.FOR	main program.
	-AINIT.FOR	initialization overlay.
	-AMAIN.FOR	game overlay.
	-ASUB.FOR	resident subroutines.
	-AIOSUB.FOR	resident subroutines.
	-ASUSP.FOR	save/restore subroutines.
	-AMAC.MAC	resident macro subroutines.
	-ADVENT.DOC	documentation file.
	-ATEXT.TXT	game data base file.
	-ADVENT.ODL	overlay description file (for RSX versions).
	-ABUILD.FOR	index file build program.

The primary changes incorporated in Release 3 are the following:

	-Improved page formatting.
	-Upper and lower case output.
	-SAVE and RESTORE.
	-Fast initialization feature.

SAVE (synonyms SUSPEND and PAUSE) permits the user to save the current
state of the game for later analysis or continuation.  RESTORE (synonym
RESUME) restores a previously SAVEd game.  The fast initialization
feature reduces the startup time of the game from 60-90 seconds to
3-5 seconds after the first game.

II. History

This version of Adventure is based on two previous versions:

	-A Fortran-10 version done by Willie Crowther and
	 Don Woods.
	-A Fortran-IV-Plus version done by Kent Blackett.

In altering the program to compile under Fortran-IV (Version 1C
or later) and to run under RT-11, the following changes were made:

	-Magic mode (maintenance mode) was removed.
	-Section 12 of the data base (magic texts) was removed.
	-The HOURS command was removed.

Crocks in the language or the compiler necessitated certain other
changes, notably the removal of Hollerith constants from arithmetic
expressions and the division of 32-bit integer arrays into multiple
16-bit integer arrays.

III. Installation Instructions (RT-11 V2C/Fortran-IV V1C)

To create an executable image, issue the following commands:

	.R FORTRA(cr)
	*ADVENT=ADVENT/V(cr)
	*AINIT=AINIT/V(cr)
	*AMAIN=AMAIN/V(cr)
	*ASUB=ASUB/V(cr)
	*AIOSUB=AIOSUB/V(cr)
	*ASUSP=ASUSP/V(cr)
	*^C

	.R MACRO(cr)
	*AMAC=AMAC(cr)
	*^C

	.R LINK(cr)

	*AINIT/O:1/C(cr)
	*AMAIN/O:1(cr)
	*^C

The linked program can be executed with the command:

	.R ADVENT(cr)

Before running the game for the first time, you must create
a dummy index file, as outlined in section VII.

When started for the first time, the program will take 60-90
seconds to create its working files (ATEXT.DAT and AINDX.DAT
on SY:).  Subsequently, startup should take only 3-5 seconds.
Do not delete ATEXT.DAT or AINDX.DAT!

IV. Installation Instructions (RT-11 V3/Fortran-IV V2)

To create an executable image, issue the following commands:

	.COMPIL/NOVEC ADVENT,AINIT,AMAIN,ASUB,AIOSUB,ASUSP(cr)

	.COMPIL AMAC(cr)

	.LINK/PROMPT ADVENT,ASUB,AIOSUB,ASUSP,AMAC(cr)
	*AINIT/O:1(cr)
	*AMAIN/O:1//(cr)

The linked program can be executed with the command:

	.R ADVENT(cr)

Before running the game for the first time, you must create
a dummy index file, as outlined in section VII.

When started for the first time, the program will take 60-90
seconds to create its working files (ATEXT.DAT and AINDX.DAT

seconds to create its working files (ATEXT.DAT and AINDX.DAT
on SY:).  Subsequently, startup should take only 3-5 seconds.
Do not delete ATEXT.DAT or AINDX.DAT!

VII.  Creating the Data Base Files

For efficiency reasons, Adventure transforms the variable-length
records in its data base (ATEXT.TXT) into a fixed length string
file (ATEXT.DAT) and an array initialization file (AINDX.DAT).
Once Adventure has created these files, you must not delete them.
Should either file (or both files) be deleted, the following procedure
will recreate them.  Note that this procedure must be executed at least
once to create the initial versions of the files:

	-Compile program ABUILD.FOR.

	-Link it with the compiled version of module ASUSP.FOR.

	-Execute the linked program.

The linked program will produce a version of AINDX.DAT with an
incompatible version number.  When Adventure is next executed, it
will note the bad version number, recompile the data base, and write
out new versions of ATEXT.DAT and AINDX.DAT.  The original version
of AINDX.DAT, which will still be extent under RSX, may be purged.

Good luck!

SUMMARY
-------

Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in
treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never
seen again.  Magic is said to work in the cave.  I will be your eyes
and hands.  Direct me with commands of 1 or 2 words.  I should warn
you that I look at only the first four letters of each word, so you'll
have to enter "NORTHEAST" as "NE" to distinguish it from "NORTH".
(Should you get stuck, type "HELP" for some general hints.  For infor-
mation on how to end your adventure, etc., type "INFO".)
			- - -
This program was originally developed by Willie Crowther.  Most of the
features of the current program were added by Don Woods (DON @ SU-AI).
The current version was done by Kent Blackett and Bob Supnik.

HELP
----

I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary
describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words
like "FOREST", "DNSTREAM", "ENTER", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "SOUTH",
"UP", or "DOWN".  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod
hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of
the action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the
object and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer
the object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in
particular, "INVENTORY" implies "TAKE INVENTORY", which causes me to
give you a list of what you're carrying.  The objects have side
effects; for instance, the rod scares the bird.  Usually people having
trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people
trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something
beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely
different tack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move long
distances with a single word.  For example, "BUILDING" usually gets
you to the building from anywhere above ground except when lost in the
forest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving a
room to the north does not guarantee entering the next from the south.
Good luck!


INFO
----

If you want to end your adventure early, say "QUIT".  To suspend your
adventure such that you can continue later, say "SUSPEND" (or "PAUSE"
or "SAVE").  To see what hours the cave is normally open, say "HOURS".
To see how well you're doing, say "SCORE".  To get full credit for a
treasure, you must leave it safely in the building, though you get
partial credit just for locating it.  You lose points for getting
killed, or for quitting, though the former costs you more.  There are
also points based on how much (if any) of the cave you've managed to
explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for getting in (to
distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack), and there are
other ways to determine whether you've been through some of the more
harrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the treasures, just
keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting happens, you
haven't found them all yet.  If something interesting DOES happen,
it means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner many
more points in the master's section.  I may occasionally offer hints
if you seem to be having trouble.  If I do, I'll warn you in advance
how much it will affect your score to accept the hints.  Finally, to
save paper, you may specify "BRIEF", which tells me never to repeat
the full description of a place unless you explicitly ask me to.
