This directory contains all of DECUS 11-340, Adventure, copied to PC
files.  They are direct ASCII copies, and contain all characters from
the RT-11 version.  In particular, the sources contain tab characters,
and presume RT-11's interpretation of tabs.  Some editing/reformatting
will be necessary if you want to work from these.

Also, please note that this directory contains the original form of
ATEXT.TXT, within which the INFO text identifies DECUS for support.
Since DECUS obviously won't support the PC version (they don't even
know me), ATEXT.TXT and ATEXT.DAT on the rest of this disk have had
that removed.  Please don't mix up the text files.
